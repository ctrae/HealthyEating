            An unhealthy diet is one of the major risk factors for a range of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity. 
            <p><b>Specific recommendations for a healthy diet include:</b> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>eating more fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and grains</li>
                    <li>cutting down on salt, sugar and fats</li>
                    <li>It is also advisable to choose unsaturated fats, instead of saturated fats</li>
                </ul>
            Improving dietary habits is a societal, not just an individual problem. Therefore it demands a population-based, multisectoral, multi-disciplinary, and culturally relevant approach.

            <h4>Obesity and noncommunicable diseases</h4>

            Reports present alarming figures for the prevalence of obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Overweight and obesity are potent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes and are major contributors to premature death.
            Data compiled for adults aged 15 years and over from 16 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region show the highest levels of overweight people in Kuwait, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Bahrain, with the prevalence of overweight/obesity ranging from 74% to 86% among women and 69% to 77% among men.
            The escalating level of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents is of particular concern, given the recent evidence linking childhood and adolescent obesity to increased risk of obesity and morbidity in adulthood.

            <b>A well-balanced diet provides all of the:</b>
            <ul>
                <li> energy you need to keep active throughout the day</li>
                <li>nutrients you need for growth and repair, helping you to stay strong and healthy and help to prevent diet-related illness</li>
            </ul>
            Keeping active and eating a healthy balanced diet can also help you to maintain a healthy weight.

            Deficiencies in some key nutrients – such as vitamin A, B, C and E, and zinc, iron and selenium – can weaken parts of your immune system.

            
            <h4>
                Type 2 diabetes
            </h4>
            Maintaining a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet that’s low in saturated fat and high in fibre found in whole grains can help to reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

            <h4>
                Heart health
            </h4>

            A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy can help to reduce your risk of heart disease by maintaining blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
            High blood pressure and cholesterol can be a symptom of too much salt and saturated fats in your diet.
            Eating a portion of oily fish – such as salmon and trout – each week can also help to lower your risk of developing heart disease. The high levels of omega-3 fatty acids in oily fish are good for heart health.
            
         
            <h4>
                Strong bones and teeth
            </h4>
            A diet rich in calcium keeps your teeth and bones strong and can help to slow bone loss (osteoporosis) associated with getting older.
           
            <p><b>Calcium is usually associated with dairy products, but you can also get calcium by eating:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>sardines, pilchards or tinned salmon (with bones)</li>
                <li>dark green vegetables – such as kale and broccoli</li>
                <li>calcium-fortified foods – such as soya products, fruit juices and cereals</li>
            </ul>
            
            
           
            As vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, make sure you get outside (your body gets vitamin D from the sun) and have plenty of foods containing vitamin D in your diet – such as oily fish and fortified cereals.

            <h4>How to manage your weight</h4>
            Eating a healthy diet that includes lots of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and a moderate amount of unsaturated fats, meat and dairy can help you to manage your weight. Having a good variety of these foods every day leaves less room for foods that are high in fat and sugar which can lead to weight gain.
            Together with exercise, eating a healthy diet can also help you to lower your cholesterol levels and blood pressure and decrease your risk of type 2 diabetes.

                    <h3>Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h3>
                    <p> Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.
                        Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.
                        They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
                    </p>                
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Eat lots of fruit and veg</h3>
                    <p> It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
                        Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?
                        A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.                        
                    </p>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</h3>
                    <p> Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.
                        Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.
                        Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. 
                        <p><b>Oily fish include:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>salmon</li>

                        </ul>

                <li>
                    <h3> Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h3>
                    <p> You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.
                        <p>There are 2 main types of fat: <b>saturated and unsaturated</b>. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p>On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.
                        Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5. In addition, full-fat dairy products, such as cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt, are recommended up to the age of 2 years.
